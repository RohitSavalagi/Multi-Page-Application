JS Calculator
Objective: Implement calculator

* Technical requirements:
1. Implement calculator with already attached layout for that.
2. The set of entered numbers should be displayed on the calculator board when you click on the number keys.
3. When clicking on the signs of the operators ```(*, /, +, -)``` nothing happens on the display - the program is waiting for the second number to be entered to perform the operation.
4. If the user has entered one number, selected the operator, and entered the second number, then when you press both the = button and any of the operators, the result of the previous expression should appear in the scoreboard.
5. When you press the M+ or M- keys on the left side of the display, you need to show a small letter m - this means that a number is stored in memory. Clicking on MRC will show the number from memory on the screen. Pressing MRC again should clear the memory.
